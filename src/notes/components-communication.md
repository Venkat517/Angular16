## Different ways to communicate between the components

possible ways to communicate between components in Angular:

* **Input and Output**

  This is the most common way to communicate between components. The `@Input()` decorator is used to pass data from the parent component to the child component, and the `@Output()` decorator is used to emit events from the child component to the parent component.

* **Services**

  Services are a great way to share data and logic between components. A service can be injected into any component, and it can be used to communicate with other services, APIs, or databases.

* **Template Outlet**

  The template outlet is a powerful way to communicate between components. It allows you to pass data from a parent component to a child component, and it also allows you to listen for events from the child component.

* **Local Variables**

  In some cases, you may need to communicate between components using local variables. This is not the most recommended way to communicate between components, but it can be useful in certain situations.

* **EventEmitter**

  The EventEmitter is a class that can be used to emit events. It is a more flexible way to communicate between components than the `@Output()` decorator, but it is also more complex.

* **RxJS Observables**

  RxJS Observables are a powerful way to communicate between components. They allow you to subscribe to events from other components, and they also allow you to emit events from your own components.
